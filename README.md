# YelpCamp
A campground social media site for sharing reviews, experiences, and advice about campgrounds from around the world

This project is being completed as part of the Colt Steele Web Development Bootcamp. The general idea for the site is to house a social community of camp-goers where they can share reviews, insights, recommendations, and experiences. 

Any "camper" can add locations, provide images they've taken, and converse with fellow hobbyists about what they love - the outdoors
